Type the following two commands at the Steam >prompt:

  * force_install_dir c:/AlienSwarmServer/   
  * app_update 635 validate

Make sure downloading 100% completion with message "Success! App '635' fully installed."

  * If any assertion failed or error found, start the following 3 steps:
  *   1.delete AlienSwarmServer folder and steamcmd folder,
  *   2.create AlienSwarmServer folder and unzip steamcmd.zip again, 
  *   3.restart from step "Right click on the folder and select 'SVN Checkout'".
